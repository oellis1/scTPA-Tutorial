# scTPA-Tutorial
A guide on how to set up scTPA for Windows.

### Introduction
This tutorial is targeted at users who would like to run the scTPA program locally (http://sctpa.bio-data.cn/sctpa/) on a PC. The local application should be used for files over 150mb-- **otherwise, use the web interface!**
As someone who has coding experience but is unfamiliar with using Powershell/Windows, I ran into many issues trying to set this up. Below, I will provide a guide to set up the program, as well as some issues I ran into and how I fixed them. I hope this helps!

### Getting Started
The first step to setting up scTPA is to familiarize yourself with Microsoft's Powershell application. I was mislead into thinking I had to download Ubuntu for Microsoft in order to get this program to run. Maybe you can run it this way, but I personally ran into a lot of permission issues using a 3rd-party application. Powershell is Microsoft's equivalent to Ubuntu on Linux or Mac's terminal application. It will allow you to open and run the R script that contains the scTPA application.
This is what it looks like when you open Powershell:
